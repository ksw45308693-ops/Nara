# Product

<!-- impeccable:product-schema 1 -->

## Platform

web

## Stack

Go 1.27 modular monolith, server-rendered HTML, plain CSS and JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Nginx, and FreeBSD amd64.

## Users

- Company staff who monitor public procurement notices without repeatedly searching 나라장터.
- Tenant administrators who configure filters, recipients, schedules, and members.
- Platform administrators who manage tenants and collection health.

## Product Purpose

Collect public notices once, match each tenant's practical rules, and deliver a concise daily digest without manual searching.

## Positioning

The product turns one shared public-data collection stream into tenant-specific, explainable matches. Every match shows the rule that selected it.

## Operating Context

The first deployment runs on an existing FreeBSD virtual server inside the company network. Users access it through a browser. The initial pilot uses one tenant but preserves SaaS tenant boundaries.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- Monitor construction, service, goods, and foreign-procurement notices.
- Collect hourly and perform a seven-day initial backfill.
- Support include, exclude, category, agency, region, amount, and deadline filters.
- Send scheduled HTML email through an existing SMTP server.
- Use only free and open-source software and the free public-data API.
- Do not use paid APIs, generative AI, frontend frameworks, Redis, or external queues.
- FreeBSD amd64 is the only officially supported server target for the pilot.

## Brand Commitments
